# Mercury group project

## How to use the docker compose file
1. We used [docker-compose file](https://https://github.com/generation-de-x3-lle/mercury-project/blob/main/.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml).
2. To run docker command `docker-compose up`.
3. `docker-compose up` was executed in the CLI to create a network of containers.
4. Container is used for Database management **adminer**.
5. **PostgresSQL** was connected using **docker**.

## Creating SQL Script
1. We created a test script first and pushed it into the **adminer** to see if it is working, that was successful.
2. We have created all four tables and name it: basket, branch, products and transactions.
3. We have verified the tables that were created.
