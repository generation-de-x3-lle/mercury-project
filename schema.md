# Scheme design to model data

**These are sample database tables we want transfer our data into. We have chosen our fieldnames which are in the tables**

**The way the tables have been designed could:**
1. Help answer queries and make it straightforward as possible
2. Solve problems within the data
3. Remove and transform data
4. Help identify trends and insights

## Table : 1
| -----------| -----------   | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| date_time  | location      | order         | amount         | payment_type |
|            |               |               |                |              |
|            |               |               |                |              |
